# innovate
Multi-agent workflow simulating a design thinking workshop where a brand manager, a creative director, a market researcher and a marketing assistant collaborate to perform all the task required to generate innovative product or service features. Trigger the multi-agent workflow with 3 inputs: brand, product/service, target audience, that's it!
